    Call Back function :

    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

    The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.

    Another Definatioin by Wikipedia :
    In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after"[1] function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later point in time as in an asynchronous callback
    
    Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in 
    many modern web APIs, such as fetch().
